### Hi there, I'm Brendan 👋

I'm a software engineer at Mozilla working on [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) 📨

Before that, I have worked at [Element](https://element.io/) for a few years, working on [the Matrix open standard](https://matrix.org/) 🛰️, following some time helping [Cozy Cloud](https://cozy.io) ☁️ empower people with control over their personal data.

You can also follow me on [my blog](https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/), where I sometimes write about what I'm up to, or on 🐘 [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@babolivier) or 🐦️ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BrenAbolivier).

See you around! 🏞️
